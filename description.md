# AutoCodeRover: Autonomous Database Management and Code Repair Agent

## Overview
AutoCodeRover is an experimental project that demonstrates the capabilities of autonomous code agents in managing and repairing database systems. This implementation showcases the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with practical database management, creating a self-healing system that can diagnose and repair issues with minimal human intervention.

## Core Components

### 1. Autonomous Database Management
The system implements an autonomous mode that can:
- Detect database corruption and permission issues
- Analyze problems using AI-powered diagnostics
- Execute repairs automatically
- Maintain data integrity throughout the repair process

### 2. Database Integration
The implementation features a robust integration with a SQLite database system that:
- Manages a flexible todo-list structure
- Handles CRUD operations seamlessly
- Implements automatic backup and recovery mechanisms
- Maintains data consistency across operations

### 3. AI-Powered Decision Making
The system leverages OpenAI's API to:
- Analyze database states
- Generate repair strategies
- Make autonomous decisions about fixing corrupted data
- Provide detailed logging and explanation of actions taken
